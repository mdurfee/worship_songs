The Stand


Verse 1
You stood before creation
Eternity in Your hand
You spoke the earth into motion
My soul now to stand


Verse 2
You stood before my failure
And carried the cross for my shame
My sin weighed upon Your shoulders
My soul now to stand


Misc 1
(Pre-Chorus)
So what can I say
And what can I do
But offer this heart O God
Completely to You


Verse 3
So I'll walk upon salvation
Your Spirit alive in me
My life to declare Your promise
My soul now to stand


Chorus 1
So I'll stand
With arms high and heart abandoned
In awe of the One who gave it all
I'll stand
My soul Lord to You surrendered
All I am is Yours
